### Abstract
We study the effects of electronic interactions on the Bernevig-Hughes-Zhang model using real-space density matrix renormalization group technique. We employed the full multi-orbital Hubbard interaction term to study these correlation effects and obtained the gap parameter 'm' versus interaction strength 'U' phase diagram for the Nx4 cylinder. Our results suggests that not only the topological phase persists with interaction, but we also observe a topological phase transition from a paramagnetic topological insulator to an antiferromagnetic topological insulator.

### Description
This repository includes links, code, scripts, and data to generate the figures in this paper.

### Requirements
The data in this project was generated using two different methods:
1. The data for the interacting BHZ model was generated via DMRG++ software developed by Dr. Gonzalo Alvarez. The details of the code and its successful installment on a system can be found at:
* [dmrgpp](https://github.com/g1257/dmrgpp)

2. The data for the non-interacting BHZ model was generated via exact diagonalization. The details of this code is provided in the "ED-code" folder of this repository.
